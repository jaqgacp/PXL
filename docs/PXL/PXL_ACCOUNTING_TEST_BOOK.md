# PXL Accounting Test Book

This file records expected accounting/reporting scenarios that must be executed before a finding can be marked `Retested Passed`.

## AR-AGING-ASOF-001 - Future Receipt and Credit Memo Exclusion

Status: Scoped implementation documented, not seeded/executed.

Related findings: PXL-AUD-011.

Scenario:

| Step | Transaction | Date | Amount | Expected Reporting Behavior |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| 1 | Posted Sales Invoice | 2026-01-15 | 10,000.00 | AR aging as of 2026-01-31 shows 10,000.00 open. |
| 2 | Posted Official Receipt | 2026-02-15 | 4,000.00 | AR aging as of 2026-01-31 still shows 10,000.00 open; AR aging as of 2026-02-28 reduces by 4,000.00. |
| 3 | Applied Credit Memo | 2026-02-20 | 1,000.00 | AR aging as of 2026-01-31 still shows 10,000.00 open; AR aging as of 2026-02-28 shows 5,000.00 open. |

Expected accounting behavior:

- No new GL entry is created by running the aging report.
- AR aging must be a report/subledger view of already posted SI, OR, and CM activity.
- Future-dated receipt and credit memo applications must not reduce a prior as-of aging report.
- The scenario can only pass when AR aging, customer ledger, GL AR control, report drilldown, and audit trail evidence reconcile for both as-of dates.

## AP-AGING-ASOF-001 - Future Payment Voucher Exclusion

Status: Documented, not seeded/executed.

Related findings: PXL-AUD-012.

Scenario:

| Step | Transaction | Date | Amount | Expected Reporting Behavior |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| 1 | Posted Vendor Bill | 2026-01-10 | 12,000.00 | AP aging as of 2026-01-31 shows 12,000.00 open. |
| 2 | Posted Payment Voucher cash portion | 2026-02-10 | 7,000.00 | AP aging as of 2026-01-31 still shows 12,000.00 open. |
| 3 | Posted Payment Voucher EWT portion | 2026-02-10 | 1,000.00 | AP aging as of 2026-02-28 shows 4,000.00 open. |

Expected accounting behavior:

- No new GL entry is created by running the aging report.
- AP aging must be a report/subledger view of already posted VB and PV activity.
- Future-dated payment voucher applications must not reduce a prior as-of aging report.
- The scenario can only pass when AP aging, supplier ledger, GL AP control, report drilldown, and audit trail evidence reconcile for both as-of dates.
- Vendor credit application handling is out of scope for this scenario and remains open under PXL-AUD-019.

## AP-AGING-ASOF-002 - Vendor Credit Application Inclusion

Status: Scoped implementation documented, not seeded/executed.

Related findings: PXL-AUD-019.

Scenario:

| Step | Transaction | Date | Amount | Expected Reporting Behavior |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| 1 | Posted Vendor Bill | 2026-03-05 | 8,000.00 | AP aging shows 8,000.00 open before credit application. |
| 2 | Posted/Applied Vendor Credit | 2026-03-20 | 2,000.00 | AP aging as of 2026-03-31 should show 6,000.00 open after the credit. |

Expected accounting behavior:

- Vendor credit applications should reduce AP aging as of the vendor credit application/posting date.
- Input VAT adjustment and supplier ledger impact should reconcile to the posted vendor credit and GL.
- The scenario can only pass when AP aging, supplier ledger, GL AP control, input VAT adjustment support, report drilldown, and audit trail evidence reconcile.
- Session 8 added scoped UI handling for stored vendor credit applications, but this scenario is not `Retested Passed` until seeded execution validates it.

## VC-APPLICATION-DATE-001 - User-Controlled Vendor Credit Application Date

Status: Documented, not seeded/executed.

Related findings: PXL-AUD-020.

Scenario:

| Step | Transaction | Date | Amount | Expected Reporting Behavior |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| 1 | Posted Vendor Bill | 2026-04-05 | 9,000.00 | AP aging shows 9,000.00 open before credit application. |
| 2 | Posted Vendor Credit | 2026-04-10 | 3,000.00 | Vendor credit is available for application. |
| 3 | Apply Vendor Credit | 2026-04-15 | 3,000.00 | AP aging as of 2026-04-14 shows 9,000.00 open; AP aging as of 2026-04-30 shows 6,000.00 open. |

Expected accounting behavior:

- The vendor credit application UI should collect and pass the intended application date.
- The application date should be validated against the company's open fiscal periods by both UI and RPC.
- AP aging should use the stored `vendor_credit_applications.applied_date`, not the system date when the user happened to click Apply.
- Sessions 9-10 added scoped UI and RPC handling for application date; this scenario is not `Retested Passed` until seeded execution validates AP aging, supplier ledger, GL/AP control expectations, and audit trail evidence.

## VC-APPLICATION-REVERSAL-001 - Controlled Vendor Credit Application Reversal

Status: Documented, not seeded/executed.

Related findings: PXL-AUD-021.

Scenario:

| Step | Transaction | Date | Amount | Expected Reporting Behavior |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| 1 | Posted Vendor Credit | 2026-05-10 | 2,500.00 | Vendor credit is open and available. |
| 2 | Apply Vendor Credit to Posted Vendor Bill | 2026-05-12 | 2,500.00 | AP aging reduces the vendor bill balance and vendor credit remaining balance becomes 0.00. |
| 3 | Reverse Application Through Controlled Workflow | 2026-05-15 | 2,500.00 | AP aging restores the bill balance, vendor credit remaining balance returns to 2,500.00, and reversal evidence is retained. |

Expected accounting behavior:

- Direct deletes of application rows should not be allowed.
- A reversal RPC should restore vendor credit balance/status and preserve an audit trail.
- AP aging and supplier ledger should reflect the reversal as of the reversal date.
